# PuzzleLevelTool
Unity tool that allows you to create levels for a game called "Ceratonia", a puzzle card game based on connections and traits between cards (not released).

You choose the size of the board, and a board with coordinates appears in the Level Scriptable Object's Inspector. With a toolbar, you can choose what to add to the cells. It also contains a card and terrain selector that allows you to choose any of these, as long as they are in the "Resources" folder. All this working in real time in a scene that only serves to visualize the levels.
